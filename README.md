TASK 3 : TIC-TAC-TOE WEB APPLICATION

DESCRIPTION:- To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.

- Highlighted turn indicator (e.g., Turn for: X).
- Real-time win detection with a "X Wins!" or "O Wins!" message.
- Play Again button to restart the game.
- Visually appealing design with a dark gradient background and neon accents.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: Structures the game board and interface elements.
- CSS: Styles the application with a modern look, including the game grid and buttons.
- JavaScript: Manages game logic, including handling clicks, tracking game state, and checking winning conditions.

Usage:
- Players take turns clicking cells to place 'X' or 'O'.
- The game announces the winner when three markers align in a row, column, or diagonal.
- Click "Play Again" to start a new game.
